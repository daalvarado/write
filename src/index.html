                    <p class="text">Using a deceptively simple antenna roughly the size and shape of a dinner table, radio astronomers have
                        made an unprecedented discovery: telltale fingerprints from the earliest stars in the cosmos, pressed
                        into the afterglow of the universe’s birth. That signal, imprinted more deeply into the Big Bang’s
                        afterglow than scientists expected, could reveal much about the universe’s youth and hint at the
                        nature of dark matter, that mysterious substance that far outweighs all the normal matter in existence.
                        The findings and the theoretical work describing dark matter’s potential role, described in two papers
                        in the journal Nature, excited theoretical and experimental physicists alike. “To my mind … it’s
                        Nobel Prize-worthy twice, if it’s real,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard University theoretical astrophysicist
                        who was not involved in the research. “Not only did they detect the signal, but it actually is bigger
                        than one can accommodate in the standard cosmological model. And you need new physics in order to
                        explain a signal as big as they detected.” The first stars in the universe, born on the order of
                        100 million years after the Big Bang, some 13.8 billion years ago, were not like the stars of today.
                        Because they coalesced out of the soup of neutral hydrogen (and a little helium) that filled the
                        early cosmos, these stars grew large, burned bright and blue and then died quickly, probably surviving
                        around 100 million years, give or take. (Our own sun, by comparison, is already 4.6 billion years
                        old and has billions more years to go.) When these short-lived stars went supernova, their explosive
                        deaths forged heavier elements that seeded generations of stars to come. So understanding that stellar
                        vanguard that brought light to the universe is key to understanding all the stars in galaxies today.
                        “We knew they should be different, and they really lay the seeds for everything that comes after
                        them,” lead author Judd Bowman, an experimental astrophysicist at Arizona State University, said
                        of these primordial stars. But it’s exceedingly difficult to glimpse actual evidence of those first
                        stars, and thus to get a firm grip on the timeline of events in this epoch of cosmic history. That’s
                        partly because there aren’t a lot of stars to see in this early era. But it’s also because the universe
                        is expanding, and that expansion is stretching that ancient starlight into longer, “redder” wavelengths.
                        That means that even NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, which has been able to see galaxies from 400
                        million years or so after the Big Bang, can’t spot them. In a project dubbed EDGES (short for Experiment
                        to Detect Global EoR Signature), Bowman and his colleagues decided to take a different approach.
                        In recent years, astronomers have studied the radiation afterglow of the Big Bang, known as the cosmic
                        microwave background, or CMB. This radiation is subtle but extends over the entire sky, and astronomers
                        have studied its tiny fluctuations in order to understand the underlying structure of the early universe.
                        The scientists realized that the cosmic microwave background, mixed with that soup of neutral hydrogen,
                        might actually hold a subtle fingerprint from those primordial stars. That’s because ultraviolet
                        starlight would have shifted the hydrogen atoms’ energy state, allowing them to absorb a particular
                        wavelength out of the cosmic microwave background. Somewhere in the wavelengths that make up the
                        CMB, they’d find this telltale slice of missing light. Finding this fingerprint in the universe’s
                        afterglow was easier said than done. The local universe hurls an overwhelming amount of radio waves
                        at Earth, drowning out this muted signal. On top of that, the scientists were using a fairly simple
                        instrument — a single radio detector roughly 6.4 feet long, about the size and shape of a dining
                        table. With this single antenna, looking for a signal in one particular part of the sky would have
                        been impossible. Instead, they looked at the average radio spectrum across the entire sky and searched
                        for discrepancies. They also placed their detector in a remote region of Australia, in the hopes
                        of being as far away from human-generated radio waves as possible.</p>

                    <p class="text">It’s not often that a microscopic organism gains celebrity status, but that’s exactly what tardigrades
                        have managed to accomplish. The tiny organisms, often called “water bears” due to their stout body
                        shapes, have gained popularity thanks to their undeniable cuteness and incredible resiliency. Considered
                        “micro-animals,” tardigrades are thought to date back as far as 530 million years and they’re still
                        around today. Now, an entirely new species of the tiny creatures has been discovered in a rather
                        unlikely place: a parking lot. A scientist from the Keio University in Tokyo gathered the groundbreaking
                        specimen from a chunk of moss in a city parking lot and, after closely examining it under a microscope
                        and sampling its DNA, realized it was a first-of-its-kind discovery. The new tardigrade species,
                        called Macrobiotus shonaicus, is only slightly different from many other known species, but its stunted
                        legs make it easily recognizable under a high-powered lens. The species also has a unique egg shape
                        with protrusions that researchers believe may help them attach to surfaces. A paper on the discovery
                        was published this week in PLoS One. As a whole, Tardigrades are an incredible group of animals.
                        Various species have demonstrated the ability to live in incredibly harsh conditions, and they are
                        capable of going into a dormant state and then reanimating years or even decades later. Researchers
                        have pushed them to the limits and been consistently surprised with their ability to withstand extreme
                        temperatures and even space travel. There are well over 1,000 different species of tardigrade on
                        record, so the discovery of a new member of the family isn’t entirely shocking. However, it’s remarkable
                        to think that a never-before-documented animal could be lurking right under your nose without you
                        even realizing it. “Tardigrades are as close to indestructible as it gets on Earth,” Rafael Alves
                        Batista of the University of Oxford told National Geographic. “But it’s possible that there are other
                        resilient species examples elsewhere in the universe.” </p>

                    <p class="text">Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft are delivering pitiful levels of take-home pay to the hundreds of thousands
                        of US independent contractors providing their own vehicles and driving skills to deliver the core
                        service, according to an MIT CEEPR study examining the economics of the two app platforms. The report
                        catalyses the debate about conditions for workers on gig economy platforms, and raises serious questions
                        about the wider societal impacts of tax avoiding, VC-funded tech giants. The study, entitled The
                        Economics of Ride-Hailing: Driver Revenue, Expenses and Taxes, and which was carried out by the MIT
                        Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, surveyed more than 1,100 Uber and Lyft ride-hailing
                        drivers combined with detailed vehicle cost information — factoring in costs such as fuel, insurance,
                        maintenance and repairs — to come up with a median profit per hour worked. The upshot? The researchers
                        found profit from ride-hail driving to be “very low”. On an hourly basis, the median profit was $3.37
                        per hour, with 74% of drivers earning less than the minimum wage in the state where they operate.
                        They also found a median driver generates $0.59 per mile of driving but incurs costs of $0.30 per
                        mile; and almost a third (30 per cent) of drivers were found to incur expenses exceeding their revenue
                        or to be losing money for every mile they drive. The research also looked at how ride-hailing profits
                        are taxed, and suggests that in the US a majority of driver profits are going untaxed owing to how
                        mileage deduction is handled for tax purposes — suggesting Uber and Lyft’s business are denuding
                        the public purse too. From the study: On a monthly basis, mean profit is $661/month (median $310).
                        Drivers are eligible to use a Standard Mileage Deduction for tax purposes ($0.54/mile in 2016) which
                        far exceeds median costs per mile of $0.30/mile. Because of this deduction, most ridehailing drivers
                        are able to declare profits that are substantially lower. Mean drivers who use a Standard Mileage
                        Deduction would declare taxable profit of $175 rather than the $661 earned. These numbers suggest
                        that approximately 74% of driver profit is untaxed. The authors add that if their $661/month mean
                        profit is representative then the US’ Standard Mileage Deduction facilitates “several billion in
                        untaxed income for hundreds of thousands of ride-hailing drivers nationwide”. So what does the study
                        tell us about the ride-hailing business model? “It tells us that it’s a shitty place to work,” says
                        Mark Tluszcz, co-founder and CEO of Mangrove Capital Partners who has described the gig economy model
                        as the modern day sweatshop, and says his VC firm made a conscious decision not to invest in gig
                        economy companies because the model is exploitative. “It tells you that it’s a great place if you’re
                        a company. It’s really a poor place to be an employee or be a worker.” The exploitative asymmetry
                        of ride-hailing platforms comes because workers have a certain amount of fixed costs but the platform
                        intermediary can just hike its commission at will and lower the service cost to the end user whenever
                        it wants to increase competitiveness vs a rival business. “At the end of the day there are a certain
                        amount of fixed costs [for drivers],” says Tluszcz. “You have to buy a car, you have to get insurance,
                        you have to pay for gas… And if you as an intermediary, which those platforms are, are taking an
                        increasing amount of commission — 10%, 15%, now 20 in most of their markets — and then you’re using
                        the price of the trip as a way of beating your competitor… then you as a driver are sitting there
                        with basically all of your fixed costs and your income is going down and frankly the only way to
                        cover your costs is to spend more hours in the car. “Which is frankly what’s clearly illustrated
                        by this study. These people have to spend so much time to cover their costs when you break it down
                        to an hourly revenue, it’s a pitiful amount. And by the way you have no social coverage because you’ve
                        got to take care of that yourself.” At the time of writing neither Uber not Lyft had responded to
                        a request for comment on the MIT study. But an Uber spokesperson told The Guardian the company believes
                        the research methodology and findings are “deeply flawed”, adding: “We’ve reached out to the paper’s
                        authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.”
                        Tluszcz was quick to dispatch that critique. “MIT is not some second tier organization that did this
                        study,” he points out. “For me that’s a reference moment when MIT says look, there’s an issue here…
                        There’s something wrong in the model and we can tolerate it for a period of time but ultimately we’re
                        creating this lost generation of people.” “These business are built on situations in the market that
                        are not realistic,” he tells TechCrunch. “They took advantage of a hole in legislation… Governments
                        let that happen. And it made all of sudden services cheaper. But people have to eat. People have
                        to live. And ultimately there’s only 100% of a cake. “Cabbies in the UK are not millionaires; they
                        make a decent living. But they make a decent living because there’s a certain price-point to offer
                        the service. And in every industry you have that. There is a certain fair price point to be able
                        to live in that industry… And clearly right now, in the ride-sharing businesses, you don’t have it.”
                        In Europe, where Uber’s business has faced a series of legal challenges, the company has begun offering
                        some subsidized insurance products for platform workers — including one for Uber Eats couriers across
                        Europe and a personal injury and insurance product for drivers in the UK. In January in the UK it
                        also announced a safety cap on the number of consecutive hours drivers on its platform can accept
                        trips, after coming under rising political and legal pressure on safety and working conditions. Last
                        year Uber also lost its first appeal against an employment tribunal that judged a group of Uber drivers
                        to be workers, not self-employed contractors as it had claimed — meaning they are entitled to workers
                        rights such as holiday and sick pay. Uber also had its license to operate in London withdrawn last
                        fall, with the local transport regulator citing concerns about safety and corporate responsibility
                        as key considerations for not renewing the company’s private hire vehicle license. Tluszcz’s view
                        is that such moves prefigure a more major shift incoming in Europe that could cement permanent roadblocks
                        to business models that function via intentional worker exploitation. “The flaw in the [gig economy]
                        model as a worker is so big that it seems to be quite clear that European governments are going to
                        be looking at this and saying this is just not the European ethos. It’s just not,” he argues. “There’s
                        going to be a moment when all these things are clashing. And I think it’s a cultural clash that we
                        have really, between European values of equity and American values of just pure market capitalism.
                        “You can’t expect somebody making $3.37 an hour to take a part of that to contribute to retirement
                        and social coverage. What the hell do you live on?” he adds. “We’re creating the next lost generation
                        of people who simply don’t have enough money to live and those companies are fundamentally enabling
                        it under the premise that they’re offering a cheaper service to consumers… And I just don’t think
                        Europe will put up with this.” Last month the UK government confirmed its intent to act on this area
                        by announcing a package of labor market reforms intended to respond to changes driven by the rise
                        of gig economy platforms. It dubbed the strategy a ‘Good Work Plan’ — billing it as an expansion
                        of workers rights and saying “millions” more workers would get new day-one rights, coupled with a
                        tighter enforcement regime on platforms and companies to ensure they are providing sick and holiday
                        pay rights. “We are proud to have record levels of employment in this country but we must also ensure
                        that workers’ rights are always upheld,” said the UK prime minister, also emphasizing that her goal
                        was to build “an economy that works for everyone”. It’s likely to publish more detail on the employment
                        law reform later this year. But the direction of travel for gig economy platforms in Europe looks
                        clear: Away from being freely able to exploit legal loopholes and towards a much more tightly managed
                        framework of employment and workforce welfare regulations to ensure that underlying support structures
                        (such as the UK’s national minimum wage) aren’t just being circumvented by clever engineering and
                        legal positioning. “This for me is an inherent dilemma one has between capitalism and some level
                        of socialism which we have in Europe,” adds Tluszcz. “This is a clash of two fundamentally different
                        views of the world and ultimately as a company you have to be a company that views your role in society
                        as one of being a contributor — and tech companies can’t hide behind the fact; they must do the same.
                        “And unfortunately all these ride-sharing businesses, and including most of these gig economy companies,
                        are just trying to take advantage of holes and frankly I don’t see them at all looking at their reason
                        to be as at least having a component of ‘I’m good for the society in which I operate’. They don’t.
                        They just simply don’t care. “That’s a dilemma we have as consumers, because on the one hand we like
                        the fact that it’s cheap. But we wish that people could all have a decent living.” Whether US companies
                        will be forced into a less exploitative relationship with their US workers remains to be seen. Tluszcz’s
                        view is that it will need some kind of government intervention for these types of companies to rethink
                        how their models operate and who they are impacting. “Tech companies frankly have an equal amount
                        of responsibility to be great corporate citizens. And right now it feels — particularly because many
                        of these tech companies are born in the US — it almost feels like this Americanism about them says
                        I don’t have to be a good corporate citizen. I’m going to take advantage of the world for me and
                        my shareholders,” he says. “I’m a capitalist but I do think there’s some moral guidance you have
                        to have about the business you’re building. And the US tech companies, around the world — certainly
                        in Europe — are being highly criticized… Where is your moral compass? And unfortunately, today, sitting
                        here, you have to say they lost it.”

                    <p class="text">Some 2,000 years ago, perhaps, ancient artists in the Arabian desert climbed tall rock outcrops and carved
                        life-size camels into the stone. Now, archaeologists exploring a site in northwest Saudi Arabia have
                        discovered about a dozen of the humped sculptures. Although camel art has been found in other parts
                        of the Arabian Peninsula, the newly uncovered engravings at the so-called “Camel Site” are stylistically
                        unique. The findings, which were reported Tuesday, could help provide insight into the history and
                        development of rock art on the Arabian Peninsula. “This is a major new discovery and in some ways
                        a completely new type of rock art in Saudi Arabia,” said Maria Guagnin, an archaeologist from the
                        Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History who was not involved in the study. “The naturalistic,
                        almost three-dimensional depictions are unlike anything else I’ve seen before and highlight the skills
                        of their prehistoric engravers.” Though much of the artwork is damaged from erosion or vandalism,
                        the parts still visible suggest careful attention to detail. Sometimes the camels were carved alongside
                        other beasts of burden, like donkeys. Continue reading the main story Related Coverage Hundreds of

                        In one rock panel there is a camel lying on the ground with its head tilted toward a donkey that
                        is on its feet. The two are nearly touching. “It raises its head to the head of the donkey, like
                        Michelangelo in the Vatican — it’s the connection of two species,” said Guillaume Charloux, an archaeologist
                        at the French National Center for Scientific Research and lead author on the paper, which appeared
                        in the journal Antiquity. “To me, it’s a real piece of art.” Dr. Charloux along with Hussain al-Khalifah
                        from the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Heritage, led a team to explore the site in Al Jawf. “When
                        we arrived at the site, we were astonished,” said Dr. Charloux. The team conducted three short visits
                        in 2016 and 2017. They found 11 camels, two donkeys and one unknown horse-like animal. Despite their
                        detailed artwork, the ancient artists left very few inscriptions or pieces of writing behind unlike
                        at many other rock art locations. That left the team with many unanswered questions, like who carved
                        the sculptures? How did they carve them? And why camels? Dr. Charloux suspects the engravers were
                        influenced by Nabatean art, which came from an ancient nomadic people in the area, as well as the
                        Parthians from what is now Iran. The Camel Site, he said, may have served as a border that signaled
                        the edge of the Nabatean territory. It also could have been a rest stop for caravans crossing the
                        desert to trade, or a spot to worship. Dr. Charloux said based on its similarities to other works,
                        it most likely dated to about 2,000 years ago. But the site is currently on private land that has
                        been damaged by bulldozers, and it is difficult to scientifically date. Laila Nehme, an archaeologist
                        also from the French National Center for Scientific Research but not involved in the paper, said
                        the work was unique because it was carved in relief, but added that she wasn’t ready to associate
                        the work with the Nabateans or any other group in the region. Peter Magee, an archaeologist from
                        Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania said the finding shows the ingenuity of those who lived in ancient
                        Arabia. But he pointed out that without scientific dating, the findings were tentative. “An even
                        earlier date for these amazing sculptures cannot be ruled out,” Dr. Magee said.</p>

                    <p class="text"> Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium & Safari Park welcomes a newborn reticulated giraffe to the Family! Baby
                        Austin made his debut into the world on Feb. 18, 2018. At just a few days old, this precious calf
                        is already standing over 6 feet tall! Austin was born strong and healthy. He and his mother are doing
                        great and will be on display each day at the giraffe exhibit. Female giraffes have a gestation of
                        up to 15 months, one of the longest gestations in the animal kingdom. "The calf is thriving under
                        the close watch of his attentive mother. Over the next few weeks, keepers will continue to introduce
                        mother and baby to the rest of the herd," said Wildlife World’s deputy director, Jack Ewert. At Wildlife
                        World’s 12-foot-tall giraffe feeding station, visitors have an opportunity to feed and come face-to-face
                        with the giraffes and see Austin. Using their 18-inch tongue and prehensile lips, these gentle giants
                        will eat a mouthful of pellets right out of your hand for a one of a kind experience! In the wild,
                        the giraffe population is under a lot of pressure. This is largely due to habitat loss, fragmentation,
                        degradation, poaching and ultimately the growth of the human population. In 2016, the species was
                        declared vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Joining in the fight
                        to save the giraffe population from extinction, Wildlife World has raised nine giraffes in the last
                        16 years. The giraffes are ambassadors for their species and inspire visitors to conserve and protect
                        their wild counterparts. Mickey Ollson, founder of the Wildlife World Zoo, believes the success of
                        the zoo's internationally recognized giraffe breeding program is due to the expertise and dedication
                        from its management, keepers and veterinary team, and Arizona's ideal climate conditions, which is
                        similar to the savannas throughout Africa. It's baby season at Wildlife World Zoo! Currently on display
                        are Arizona’s first marine mammal, Sunny the Sea Lion, black swans, several hoofed animal species
                        including llamas, gazelle and oryx, a variety of primate species and other youngsters throughout
                        the 100-acre park. Wildlife World’s keepers and veterinarians have raised dozens of species of wild
                        and endangered animals over the past quarter-century. Wildlife World strives to maximize genetic
                        diversity in the zoological population with its breeding programs. With more than 6.000 animals on
                        display, there's always new arrivals at Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium & Safari Park. As a USDA licensed,
                        private institution, accredited by the Zoological Association of America (ZAA) and the Alliance of
                        Marine Mammal Parks & Aquariums (AMMPA), Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium & Safari Park receives zero
                        taxpayer funding. No tax dollars have ever been spent to build or operate Wildlife World in its 33-year
                        history. Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium & Safari Park is located at 16501 W. Northern Ave., Litchfield
